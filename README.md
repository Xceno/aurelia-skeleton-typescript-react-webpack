# aurelia-skeleton-typescript-react-webpack
###### (aka. How many buzzwords fit in a project title)

## What?

I took the [aurelia-skeleton-webpack](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-typescript-webpack) template for typescript and added [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

More docs coming later. To get started just [follow the usual steps](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-typescript-webpack).

This skeleton has an example component roughly based on [this blog post](https://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/03/how-to-use-react-js-in-aurelia/).

## Credits
[This file from Allen Hendricks](https://github.com/allencoded/aurelia-react-skeleton/wiki/Aurelia-with-React-using-Webpack) pointed me in the right direction.<br/>
But in the end I dissected the config of [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) by using `yarn eject` on it.
